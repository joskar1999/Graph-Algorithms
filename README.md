# Graph-Algorithms
Graph algorithms implementation. Topological sorting based on DFS and BFS. Graphs are represented as matrix of neighborhood, list of neighborhood and table of edges.
Every implementation has DFSTopologicalSort() and BFSTopologicalSort() methods. Graphs are creating in newGraph() methods or in class constructor with one parameter.
In file ReturnGraphAlgorithms.h are finding Euler and Hamilton cycle methods, randomizing proper graph.
